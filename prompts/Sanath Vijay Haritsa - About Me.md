## About Me

### Overview

* MSc in *Applied Data Science and Analytics*
* 3 years of work experience in India
* 9 months as a Working Student at Schwarz IT

### Technical Background

* As a working student at Schwarz IT, I was part of the Generative AI and NLP team. I worked on multiple PoCs involving text generation with large language models. A key aspect of my work was evaluating generated content. One approach involved using a second language model as a judge; I collaborated closely with domain experts to align the judge model’s scores with human evaluations by defining scoring criteria and creating a scoring scale.
  For a PoC related to generating code documentation, I worked with two developers as evaluators, where I learned about the speed–accuracy trade-off between different models. For another PoC, I manually created a small gold-standard dataset and calculated precision, recall, and F1-scores. I used MLflow to track experiments, analyze errors, and improve performance.
* In addition to my technical work, I contributed to several organizational tasks. I supported the onboarding of another working student by preparing a comprehensive onboarding guide covering required tools, access roles, trainings, and key project documentation—significantly improving ramp-up efficiency.
  I also developed a KPI-based evaluation framework to assess tools like n8n, ServiceNow, and Google Agent Space, enabling business teams to build AI workflows without coding. I analyzed MIT’s report *“The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025”* and prepared actionable insights for organizational adoption of generative AI technologies.
  I enjoy writing high-quality documentation and follow good coding practices. I use OOP principles wherever possible and am familiar with CI/CD pipelines.
* During my master’s degree, I gained an in-depth understanding of applied data science with a focus on data-driven problem solving and analytical decision-making. I am skilled in mathematical and statistical modelling, data visualization, and the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques. I have experience managing complete data science workflows—from data acquisition and preprocessing to model evaluation and communicating insights. I am capable of conducting independent research, working effectively in interdisciplinary and virtual teams, and delivering both qualitative and quantitative analysis for business and research contexts.
* I completed my bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and later decided to change my career path. To build a strong foundation, I took both online (Udemy, Coursera) and offline courses in statistics, probability, machine learning, and deep learning. I also learned programming in Python and R.
* This helped me land a job at Nichesolv, where I primarily worked as a backend developer. I improved my coding skills and best practices using C# (.NET) and Java. I was also involved in several data science projects using Python, where I strengthened my skills in exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and building traditional machine learning models for classification, clustering, and time-series analysis.

### Soft Skills

* Team player with strong communication skills.
* Able to take complete responsibility for a task, work independently, and ensure timely, high-quality delivery.
* Able to take on leadership roles when needed; I am good at analyzing team strengths and weaknesses. I value a hive mindset and can motivate teams toward a common goal.

### What Sets Me Apart

* I am passionate about my work; I do it for more than just the salary. I have a genuine interest in how AI works and how it can make meaningful improvements in people’s lives.
* I am determined and don’t give up easily. Even when a challenge knocks me down, I take a break and come back with more determination.
* I am dedicated and willing to go the extra mile beyond the usual 9–6.
* I am continuously learning German—I listen to German music and podcasts, watch German shows, and actively try to integrate into society.

### Hobbies and Interests

* Sleight-of-hand card magic. I have been practising close-up magic for the last 7 years purely as a hobby.
* I have been a sportsperson all my life. In school, I played cricket, hockey, and volleyball. I have been swimming for as long as I can remember. I have played table tennis competitively. I enjoy playing football even though I’m not very good at it.
* On weekends, I enjoy having a beer with friends, going on hikes, or attending music concerts.
