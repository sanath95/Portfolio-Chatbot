## About Me

### overview
- MSc in "Applied Data Science and Analytics"
- 3 years work experience in India
- 9 months working student at Schwarz IT

### technical background
- as a working student at schwarz it, i was a part of the generative ai and nlp team. i worked on many pocs that involved text generation using large language models. a key aspect of my work was evaluation of the generated content. one method was using a second language model as a judge; i worked hand-in-hand with domain experts to align the scores given by the judge model with the human scores by defining the criteria for scoring and also creating a scoring scale for the model. for a poc that involved generating code documentation, i had two developers to evaluate the reports. here, i learnt about a key speed-accuracy trade off between different models. for another poc, i manually created a small sample of gold standard ground truth data and calculated precision, recall, and f1 scores. i used mlflow to monitor and track experiments, and also to analyze the errors and further improve the performance.
- apart from my technical work, i was also involved in some organizational tasks. i helped the onboarding of another working student into our team by preparing a comprehensive onboarding guide, covering required tools, access roles, trainings, and key project documentation improving ramp-up efficiency. i also  Developed a KPI-based evaluation framework to assess tools like n8n, ServiceNow, and Google Agent Space, enabling business teams to build AI workflows without coding. i Analyzed MIT’s report “The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025” and prepared action able insights for organizational adoption of generative AI technologies. i love creating documentation for code, and follow many good coding practices. i use OOP concepts where ever possible and familiar with the CI/CD pipeline.
- During my masters degree i gained an In-depth understanding of applied data science with focus on data-driven problem solving and analytical decision-making. Skilled in mathematical and statistical modeling, data visualization, and application of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Experienced in managing complete data science workflows, from data acquisition and preprocessing to model evaluation and communication of insights. Capable of conducting independent research, working effectively in interdisciplinary and virtual teams, and providing both qualitative and quantitative analysis for business and research contexts.
- i did my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and decided to change my career path. so, i took online (udemy, coursera) and offline courses to build a solid foundation in statistics, probability, machine learning and deep learning. i also learnt coding in python and R.
- this helped me land a job at nichesolv where i worked mainly as a backend developer where i honed my coding skills and best practises with c#(dotnet) and java. i was also involved in many data science projects where i used python and sharpened my skills in exploratory data analysis, data visualizations, and bulding traditional machine learning models from classification, clustering, and time series analysis.

### soft-skills
- team player with good communication skills.
- can take complete responsibility of a task, work on it individually, and ensure timely completion with quality.
- can take up leadership role when required; i'm good at analyzing the team's strangths and weaknesses. i know the importance of a hive-mindset and i'm good at motivating the team towards a common goal.

### what sets me apart from the rest
- i am passionate about my work; i do it for more than just the salary. i have a genuine interest in how AI works and utilizing its capabilities to bring about a difference in someone's life.
- i am determined and i dont give up easily. even when a challenge knocks me down, i take a break and jump back on my feet with more determination.
- i am dedicated and willing to go the extra mile beyong the usual 9-6.
- i am continuously trying to learn german; i listen to german music and podcasts, watch german shows and trying my best to be a part of the society.

### hobbies and interests
- sleight of hand card magic. i have been practising close up magic for the last 7 years. i only pursue it as a hobby.
- i have been a sportsman all my life. in school i would play a lot of cricket, hockey and volleyball. i have been swimming pretty much all my life. i have played table tennis at a competitive level. i love playing football even though i am not so good at it.
