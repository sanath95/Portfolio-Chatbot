## Introduction

This project is focused on developing a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to process and analyze financial data from multiple sources. The pipeline integrates real-time Bitcoin price data from the Coinbase API and a comprehensive historical dataset of gold prices sourced from Kaggle. PySpark is utilized to extract and transform this data, perform data cleansing, and build regression-based predictive models for enhanced analytical insights. The transformed data is then stored in a BigQuery data warehouse for scalable and efficient access. Additionally, dbt (data build tool) is employed to carry out further transformations on the processed data within BigQuery, optimizing it for downstream analysis and reporting. This ETL pipeline aims to streamline financial data management, support predictive modeling, and enable data-driven decision-making.

**Motivation:**

The choice of Bitcoin and gold price data is driven by the high volatility of financial markets, which generates a massive volume of data in real time. This volatility demands a system capable of processing and analyzing big data at scale, providing timely insights to support decision-making. By designing the pipeline to handle large, streaming datasets effectively, this project ensures that real-time and historical data is efficiently processed, enabling rapid analysis and predictive modeling in a fast-paced market environment.

**Data Sources:**

1. Static data: [XAU/USD Gold Price Historical Data (2004-2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/novandraanugrah/xauusd-gold-price-historical-data-2004-2024?resource=download)
2. Live data: [Coinbase: Get product candles](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/exchange/reference/exchangerestapi_getproductcandles)
    - [API](https://api.coinbase.com/api/v3/brokerage/market/products/BTC-USD/candles?granularity=ONE_MINUTE) for real-time data.

## Architecture

![architecture](./assets/marketflow_architecture.png)

The pipeline architecture for processing Bitcoin and gold price data on **Google Cloud Platform** consists of several components, as shown in the image:

1. **ETL using PySpark and BigQuery**: A Google Cloud Dataproc cluster is set up to run PySpark jobs. This cluster performs two main tasks:
   - It extracts historical gold price data from a Google Cloud Storage bucket, then calculates features like lag and moving averages, which are used to train a regression model. The transformed data is then stored in BigQuery for further analysis.
   - It calls the Coinbase API at regular intervals to gather real-time Bitcoin price data, which is also stored in BigQuery.

2. **Automation of real-time data collection**: Real-time data collection from the Coinbase API is automated using a combination of Cloud Scheduler, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Functions:
   - **Cloud Scheduler** triggers the process at defined intervals, sending a message to Pub/Sub.
   - **Pub/Sub** forwards this message to Cloud Functions.
   - **Cloud Functions** then initiates the Dataproc job to fetch and process the latest Bitcoin data, ensuring that the data collection happens without manual intervention.

3. **DBT for Data Transformation**: DBT (data build tool) is used for additional transformations within BigQuery. After the initial processing and storage in BigQuery, dbt refines the data further, applying business logic and creating analytics-ready datasets.

This architecture enables scalable, real-time data processing, storage, and transformation, ensuring that Bitcoin and gold price data is available for analysis in BigQuery with minimal latency.
